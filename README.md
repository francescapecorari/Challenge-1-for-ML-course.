# Challenge-1-for-ML-course.

Challenge 1 for the "Introduzione al machine learning" course at the university of Trieste.

The challenge focuses on performing a nearly realistic analysis of the data set bank note authentication that can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication
The assignment can be divided in several parts:

1. Load the data and pretreatment.
2. Data exploring by Unsupervised Learning techniques.
3. Construction of several models of Supervised Learning.
   
Techniques used:
- Unsupervised learning:
  - PCA
  - KMeans
  - t-SNE
  - DBSCAN
- Supervised learning:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree classifier
  - Naive Bayes
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Elastic Nets

The code is written in python in a Notebook.
